## üìö Project Description
This is a website about Rock in Rio, a recurring music festival originating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The pages gather information about the historical context of its emergence, its greatest musical performances throughout the editions, in addition to the best and worst attractions of its last edition, held in 2022.

## üìå What did I learn?

This was my initial project developed using Bootstrap, and it provided me with the opportunity to work with various components such as modals, dropdowns, navbar, buttons, and carousels.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to run the application?

> Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maricastroc/github-blog
```

> Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed. If not, you can install it from the VSCode marketplace. Go to the Extensions view in VSCode (click on the square icon on the left sidebar) and search for "Live Server". Install the extension provided by Ritwick Dey.

> Open the folder or project you want to run with Live Server in VSCode. Use the "File" menu and select "Open Folder" to open the desired folder, or simply drag the folder into the VSCode window.

> Once you have your folder open in VSCode, locate the file you want to launch with Live Server, typically an HTML file.

> Right-click on the HTML file in the Explorer sidebar or right-click in the editor window and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+L, Alt+O to open the file with Live Server.

> ‚è© Live Server will launch a development server and automatically open your HTML file in a browser. You will see a new browser tab with the URL http://localhost:5500 (or a different port if 5500 is already in use) displaying your web page.
